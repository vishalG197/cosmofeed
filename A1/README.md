Authentication Controlled Pages
Develop a simple React application with two main components: a Login page and a Home page.
The Home page should only be accessible to authenticated users.
The Login page should only be accessible to unauthenticated users.
Use React state, Context API, or Redux to manage the authentication state.
Use React Router for navigating between the Login and Home pages.
Time Limit: 20 minutes.
